# sleepsearch-backend
Introducing sleep search, a web app that return any question you search, especially about health problem like sleep, cancer, etc 

## Inspiration

## What it does

## How it works 
this app contain 5 layers of NLP machine learning, NLP deep learning, and a web scrape api.
1. first we have naive bayes model that determine where should our question passed to
2. second we have a naive bayes model again, to understand nlp input from user, and search our database for the answer. **_btw our database can contain up to 1,000,000 data_**. We use google cloud to host the mongodb
3. third, we have deep learning gpt3 model trained in thousand of data, to answer the question if the naive bayes model not quite sure of the answer.
4. fourth, we have wikipedia api and google web scrape api for the backup plan if all our trained model not quite sure of the answer.
5. and last, we have wolfram api for the backup plan if the question cant be answered on previous layers.
